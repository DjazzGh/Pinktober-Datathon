# Pinktober-Datathon
This repository contains the solutions and resources for the Pinktober Datathon challenges. The datathon focuses on various data science and machine learning tasks, organized into four distinct challenges.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into four main challenges, each with its dedicated directory and corresponding to the challenges we faced:

-   **Challenge 1: Breast Cancer Detection**
    -   **Description**: Building a binary image classification model to distinguish between malignant and normal breast tissue images.
    -   **Files**: `Challenge 1/Code.ipynb`
    -   **Kaggle link**: [https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/micro-club-pinktober-breast-cancer-detection]

-   **Challenge 2: Brain Tumor Classification**
    -   **Description**: Developing a machine learning model to automatically classify brain tumors according to their stages.
    -   **Files**: `Challenge 2/Code.ipynb`
    -   **Kaggle link**: [https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/micro-club-pinktober-brain-tumor-classification]

-   **Challenge 3: Breast Cancer Risk Prediction**
    -   **Description**: Working with anonymized clinical and demographic data to predict cancer risk.
    -   **Files**: `Challenge 3/Code.ipynb`
    -   **Kaggle link**: [https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/pink-ai-breast-cancer-risk-prediction-challenge]

-   **Challenge 4: CNN + LSTM from Scratch**
    -   **Description**: Implementing a hybrid deep learning model entirely from scratch using only NumPy.
    -   **Files**: This challenge has a more structured Python project located in `Challenge 4/Code/`
        -   `Code/`: Main directory for Challenge 4's Python code.
            -   `main.py`: The main entry point for the application.
            -   `mnist/`: Likely contains data or utilities related to the MNIST dataset.
            -   `models/`: Stores trained models or model definitions.
            -   `requirements.txt`: Lists Python dependencies for Challenge 4.
            -   `test.py`: Contains unit tests for the Challenge 4 code.
            -   `train.py`: Script for training models in Challenge 4.
            -   `utils/`: Utility functions or helper scripts.
        -   `report.md`: A markdown report detailing the findings or methodology for Challenge 4.
